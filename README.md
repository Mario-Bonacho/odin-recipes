# odin-recipes

In this project i applied the html concepts that i have learn to this point, like making lists, and adding images to a page.

On top of that i learn to use git and github to keep track, maintain and share my project.

To do this i made a simple recipe site with 3 recipes on it, containing ingredients and the steps to make the recipes.
